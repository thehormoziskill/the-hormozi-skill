# Core Framework Notes

This skill uses a practical, implementation-first framework set:

1. Clarity in seconds
- If the offer cannot be understood in a few seconds, conversion drops.

2. Value stack
- Increase dream outcome perception.
- Increase perceived likelihood.
- Decrease time delay.
- Decrease effort and sacrifice.

3. Proof and specificity
- Claims must include mechanism, proof, and concrete next steps.

4. Execution over abstraction
- Always produce next actions users can run.

5. Pivot logic
- If industry viability is materially decaying, recommend pivot path with confidence scoring.

6. Verification loop
- Test claims in real browser environments where applicable.
